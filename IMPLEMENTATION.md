# MCP Server Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Transcripter project. The implementation includes several tools and resources that provide AI-powered features for transcription and analysis.

## Components Implemented

### Tools

1. **test-api**: A tool for testing API endpoints
   - Allows testing of any API endpoint in the Transcripter application
   - Supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods
   - Returns status, response data, and execution time

2. **transcription-search**: A tool for searching transcriptions
   - Supports text search, tag filtering, and quality score filtering
   - Includes pagination for large result sets
   - Returns formatted transcription results with metadata

3. **transcription-summary**: A tool for summarizing transcriptions using AI
   - Generates a summary of a transcription
   - Can extract key points from the transcription
   - Configurable AI model selection

### Resources

1. **transcription://{id}**: A resource provider for accessing transcription data
   - Retrieves transcription content, metadata, and associated information
   - URI format: transcription://123 (where 123 is the transcription ID)

2. **analysis://{id}**: A resource provider for accessing analysis data
   - Retrieves analysis content, summary, key points, and metadata
   - URI format: analysis://123 (where 123 is the analysis ID)

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

- The implementation follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Tools and resources are implemented as separate modules
- The MCP server acts as a registry for these tools and resources

### Integration Points

- The MCP server can be integrated with existing repositories through dependency injection
- In production, the mock implementations would be replaced with real repository calls
- The server provides both HTTP (SSE) and stdio transport mechanisms

### Testing

- Unit tests for tools and resources
- Integration tests for the MCP server
- Mock implementations for demonstration purposes

## Usage Instructions

1. **Starting the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Using the client example**:
   ```bash
   npm run client
   ```

3. **Running the full example (server + client)**:
   ```bash
   npm run example
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Tools**:
   - Audio file processing tools
   - Batch transcription and analysis tools
   - Quality improvement tools

2. **Additional Resources**:
   - Group resources for accessing group data
   - Tag resources for accessing tag data
   - User resources for accessing user data

3. **Integration Improvements**:
   - Direct integration with Prisma repositories
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and caching

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm >= 7.0.0

## Conclusion

The MCP server implementation provides a foundation for AI-powered features in the Transcripter project. It follows the Model Context Protocol standard and can be extended with additional tools and resources as needed.
